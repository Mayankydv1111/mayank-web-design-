                "My project is a personal portfolio website, designed to
                showcase my skills, projects, and contact
                information. The objective of this project is to create a
                professional online presence where potential
                clients or employers can learn more about my work. The website
                features sections such as an about page,
                project gallery, resume, and contact form. I built it using
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive
                and user-friendly design. Through this project, I improved my
                front-end development skills and learned about
                UX/UI design principles."
